Twitter support
===============

The twitter package adds support for receiving Twitter events in your strategy and incorporate
those in your trading decisions. Note that since this is a realtime feed, it only makes sense
in paper trading or real trading scenarios, but not in backtesting.

Twitter support depends on **tweepy** (https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) so be sure
to have it installed before moving forward.

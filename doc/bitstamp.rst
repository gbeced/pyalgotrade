Bitstamp support
================

The bitstamp package adds support for paper trading strategies using Bitstamp's live trade and orderbook feeds
(https://www.bitstamp.net/websocket/) in conjunction with PyAlgoTrade backtesting capabilities.
Future versions will support real trading.

Bitstamp support depends on **ws4py** (https://github.com/Lawouach/WebSocket-for-Python) 
and **tornado** (http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/)
so be sure to have those installed before moving forward.
